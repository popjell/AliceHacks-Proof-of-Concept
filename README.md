There are many limitations to the ai model used. It is advised to used openai's gpt-4 model, but I'm too broke for that
With gpt-4, you can summarize more, faster, and even ask questions about the data given.
Also sometimes the model chooses a random website that has nothing. When a large scale implementation is provided, this does not matter, as that website will be one of 500 or so websites. 
However, the time complexity for the ai model used is too high to do that. Better ai models that cost money remove this problem
GPT-4 should be used. Im not using it because im a broke highscooler.
In order to use gpt-4, after paying for the tokens, you need to replace lines 47, 48, and 51 with whatever code gpt-4 needs to summarize
